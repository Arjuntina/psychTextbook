# psychTextbook

Downloaded web files of my psych textbook bc I'm stingy and don't want to pay 

Textbook info: Principles of Psychology 7th Edition by Ettinger

Open the "Textbook.html" file and follow the instructions shown.
None of the links within the pages work but I might try to change that if I really feel like it. If you want to change it, then clone the repository and push the changes -- it will make me quite happy :)

Also, please report any issues that arise. Enjoy!
